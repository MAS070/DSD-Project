# DSD_CLASS_PROJECT
To Design and Implement hardware to receive audio samples, store, process, and send to audio out using NEXYS 4 DDR. 
Project Specifications: 
1. Use built-in microphone and ADC ports   
2. Implement FIR Filter  
3. Make use of IP core of XADC  
4. Make use of BRAM memory or DDR RAM memory for storage    
5. Use modular design approach 
6. Functional simulation for FIR Filter  
7. Manage project page on Github with commented codes and cover page (read me page) 
8. Make 5 minute video presentation explaining project 


# REPORT
Report for this project is also available with name "DSD_PROJECT". it contains the introduction to project information on working of modules and modular approach.


# RESULTS
A file named "Result_and_presentation" contains the simulation results of filters and video presenattion link.
